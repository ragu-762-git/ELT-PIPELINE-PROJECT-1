# ETL-PIPELINE-PROJECT-1
This project involves creating a web based portal and allowing the clients to upload files from three different regions to the web portal. Extracting the data from the Web Portal to the GCS bucket and once the file hits the GCS bucket, the event arc trigger invokes the cloud function which initiates the dataflow job (GCS to BigQuery).
